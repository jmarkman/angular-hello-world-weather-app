# WeatherApp - A "Hello World" project for Angular

This is a project for learning about Angular. It's easy to create an Angular module that exports a class with a method that returns the string "Hello World" and then just slap that in some HTML. This is an application that will serve a real yet very basic purpose: for United States citizens, they may enter a 5-digit [ZIP Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code) (the postal code used in the United States) and retrieve the current weather for that location.
