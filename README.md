# WeatherApp - A "Hello World" project for Angular

This is a project for learning about Angular. It's easy to create an Angular module that exports a class with a method that returns the string "Hello World" and then just slap that in some HTML. This is an application that will serve a real yet very basic purpose: for United States citizens, they may enter a 5-digit [ZIP Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_Code) (the postal code used in the United States) and retrieve the current weather for that location.

I'll use the wiki associated with this project to keep tabs on the things I've done and learned about while making this webapp. Please check it as I'll actually have content in there and not just a few cursory notes!
